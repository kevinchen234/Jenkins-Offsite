= UCB Rails Security - Todo

* Add ability for admin/security users to login as other users.
* Not everyone want to install the security scaffolding by default.  However, currently
the ucb_security_config.rb file is grouped in with the scaffold generator.  This file should
have it's own generator so the user isn't forced to install a bunch of scaffolding if all they
want is to use the ldap and login filters
* Documentation needs to be reorganized.  Assume that initially people don't want to use the
scaffolding.  Scaffolding should be discussed in its own section.
