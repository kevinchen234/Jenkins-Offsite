
You also neet to <tt>include<tt> UCB::Rails::Security::ControllerMethods</tt>
in your controller class.  This can be done in each controller, but should probably be done in <tt>application.rb</tt>:

  # ../app/controllers/application.rb
  
  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    include UCB::Rails::Security::ControllerMethods
  end
